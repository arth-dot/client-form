        <h1>Terms and Conditions Agreement</h1>
        <h2>Task Acceptance</h2>
        <p>a. The Commissioner reserves the right to reject a task if they determine that they are not knowledgeable or capable of handling it, or if the task has an extremely tight deadline.</p>
        <p>b. In the event of task rejection, the Commissioner will inform the Client promptly and provide assistance in finding alternative solutions.</p>

        <h2>Cancellations</h2>
        <p>a. Strictly no cancellations are allowed once the task has been accepted by the Commissioner.</p>
        <p>b. The Client acknowledges that once the task is underway, it may not be feasible to cancel, and they will be responsible for the full payment as agreed upon.</p>

        <h2>Rush Tasks and Fees</h2>
        <p>a. A task with a time frame of 1-3 days is considered rush.</p>
        <p>b. For rush tasks, the Client agrees to pay a rush fee, which is a percentage of the agreed price:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 day: 30% of the agreed price</li>
            <li>2 days: 20% of the agreed price</li>
            <li>3 days: 10% of the agreed price</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>a. Full payment is required for rush tasks before the commencement of work.</p>
        <p>b. For tasks with a non-rush time frame, a minimum partial payment of 70% of the agreed price is required before the commencement of work, with the remaining 30% payable upon completion.</p>
        <p>c. The accepted modes of payment are bank transaction, GCash, and PayPal. The specific details for each payment method will be provided to the Client upon request.</p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>a. Both the Client and Commissioner agree to maintain the confidentiality of all transaction-related information, including task details, documents, and personal data.</p>
        <p>b. The Commissioner will not disclose any information shared by the Client to any third parties.</p>

        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>a. The Client and Commissioner agree to maintain respectful and professional communication throughout the duration of the service.</p>
        <p>b. Disrespectful behavior or communication from the Client will not be tolerated, and the Commissioner reserves the right to terminate the agreement in such cases.</p>

        <h2>Negotiability of Tasks</h2>
        <p>a. The Commissioner's "Services Offered" serves as a general guide to the services provided.</p>
        <p>b. Tasks not explicitly mentioned in the "Services Offered" may be negotiable upon discussion and agreement between the Client and Commissioner.</p>

        <h2>Ownership of Work</h2>
        <p>a. Upon receipt of full payment, the Client will own the completed work and any associated intellectual property rights.</p>
        <p>b. The Commissioner retains the right to showcase the work as part of their portfolio, while ensuring the confidentiality of the Client's identity and sensitive information.</p>

        <h2>Liability</h2>
        <p>a. The Commissioner shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising from the use or misuse of the services provided.</p>
        <p>b. The Client acknowledges that the Commissioner's role is to provide assistance and support, and they are responsible for the ethical use of the services in compliance with academic integrity policies.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>a. Either the Client or Commissioner may terminate the agreement with written notice if there is a breach of these terms and conditions or if mutually agreed upon by both parties.</p>
        <p>b. In the event of termination, the Client shall pay for the services rendered up to the termination date.</p>
